    \caption{Schematic view of our method. After importing an OCEL, emission rules are defined by the user and applied to estimate emissions on event or event-to-object level (phase 1). Following this, emissions are aggregated for events, or for objects using the object allocation framework (phase 2). Results are visualized to the user, and integrated into the (s)OCEL when exporting.}

The overall goal of our work is to develop a tool enabling emission analysis leveraging data contained in an event log in the OCEL~2.0~\cite{OCEL2} standard.
\autoref{fig:method-overview} shows how the methods used to achieve this are employed by the OCEAn application.
After importing an OCEL, the procedure is split into two phases.

Phase 1 first determines emission data based on the OCEL. The data is obtained by applying emission rules, using a specified emission factor and data from the OCEL to compute emission values on event or event-to-object (E2O) level.
\autoref{sec:est} further elaborates on this emission estimation process.

Phase 2 further processes emissions specified on event or E2O level to provide different perspectives.
First, an event perspective is obtained by performing a simple aggregation. This provides insights like emission-driving activities.
Second, the \textit{object allocation} framework is proposed, mapping emissions on event and E2O level to objects.
At its core, the framework uses different \textit{allocation rules} that identify those objects related most directly with each event.
Details of the framework and the emission rules are given in \autoref{sec:alloc}.

The OCEAn application provides a frontend to control the import and export of OCELs as well as the execution of both phases. It also visualizes the results obtained from executing both phases. Further implementation details are given in \autoref{chap:impl}.
In the following, both parts of the method are addressed.
