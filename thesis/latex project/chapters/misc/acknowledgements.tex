After rather randomly taking the IDS course four years ago,
my master's studies have been steered in a totally new direction.
This is why I would like to thank the entire PADS team
for their great teaching in the past years and catching my interest in process mining and data science.

Shout-out to my supervisor, Nina Graves, for her incredible support,
27 constructive yet fun meetings, a lot of helpful guidance, and for cracking some good and some bad jokes.

Special thanks to Eddy, Pascal, Michelle and Till for proofreading,
and to Jannes for offering his computer for my evaluation.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to my family, friends and my boyfriend for their unwavering encouragement and support.
